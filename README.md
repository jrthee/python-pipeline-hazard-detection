# python-pipeline-hazard-detection
 A program coded in Python that detects pipelining hazards within a set of MIPS instructions (given as user input), and proposes solution to hazards.
 The pipeline timing sequence is displayed to show the hazards, and displayed again after the proposed solution to correct the hazards has been implemented.
